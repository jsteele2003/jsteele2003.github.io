<div class = "refrain">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div><br> 
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.  
I learn by going where I have to go.


We think by feeling. What is there to know?   
I hear my being dance from ear to ear. <br>   
<br><div class = "refrain">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div><br> 

Of those so close beside me, which are you?   
God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there, <br>
And learn by going where I have to go.

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   
The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair; <br>  
<br><div class = "refrain">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div><br>

Great Nature has another thing to do   
To you and me; so take the lively air,   
And, lovely, learn by going where to go. 

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.   
What falls away is always. And is near.   <br>
<br><div class = "refrain">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div>
I learn by going where I have to go.</body>
