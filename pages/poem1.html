I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.  <br> 
I learn by going where I have to go. <br>


We think by feeling. What is there to know?   
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. 

Of those so close beside me, which are you?   
God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there,  <br>
And learn by going where I have to go. <br>

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   
The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. 

Great Nature has another thing to do   
To you and me; so take the lively air,   
<br>And, lovely, learn by going where to go. <br> 

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.   
What falls away is always. And is near.   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  <br> 
I learn by going where I have to go.</body>
