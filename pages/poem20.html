    I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. <br>  
    I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.   <br>
    I learn by going where I have to go. <br> <br> </div>

    We think by feeling. What is there to know?  <br> 
    I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   <br>
    I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. <br> <br> </div>

    Of those so close beside me, which are you?   <br>

    The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   <br>

    <div class = "q5">
    Great Nature has another thing to do   <br>
    To you and me; so take the lively air,   <br>
    And, lovely, learn by going where to go. <br> </div>

    This shaking keeps me steady. I should know. <br>  
    What falls away is always. And is near.   <br> 
    I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  <br> 
    I learn by going where I have to go. <br> </div>
