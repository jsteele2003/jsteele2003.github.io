  <div class = "tercets" > I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  
  I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.  
  I learn by going where I have to go. <br>


  We think by feeling. What is there to know?   
  I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   
  I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. <br>

  Of those so close beside me, which are you?   
  God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there, 
  And learn by going where I have to go. <br>

  Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   
  The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   
  I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  <br>

  Great Nature has another thing to do   
  To you and me; so take the lively air,   
  And, lovely, learn by going where to go. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "quatrain"> <br> This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.   
  What falls away is always. And is near.   
  I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  
I learn by going where I have to go.</div>
