    <div class = "text">
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. <br>  
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.   <br>
I learn by going where I have to go. 
</div> <br> <br>

<div class = "text">
We think by feeling. What is there to know?  <br> 
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   <br>
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div> <br> <br>


<div class = "text">
Of those so close beside me, which are you?   <br>
God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there, <br>   
And learn by going where I have to go.</div> <br> <br>

<div class = "text">
Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   <br>
The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   <br>
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.</div> <br> <br>

<div class = "text">
Great Nature has another thing to do   <br>
To you and me; so take the lively air,   <br>
And, lovely, learn by going where to go.</div> <br> <br>

<div class = "text">
This shaking keeps me steady. I should know. <br>  
What falls away is always. And is near.   <br> 
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.  <br> 
I learn by going where I have to go. </div><br>
